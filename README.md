This repo contains my final project submission for Stanford CS 224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning. I was advised on this project by Dr. Julia Salzmann of the Stanford Dept. of Biostatistics and Fang Wu, a PhD student that was a Teaching Assistant for the class. I worked on this project without teammates and scored a 99% in the project.
